Solution of the Hack.lu 2010 Cryptanalysis Workshop

= Introduction =

During the Hack.lu 2010 I gave, a few attendee did not succeeding decrypting thesample encrypted texts provided. For obscure reasons, it seems that the program behave differently according to the (gcc) compiler version.


= Details =

So to enable everyone to experiment successfully, you will find here the following
data:

 * binary file of decrypt_para program
 * binary file of decipher program
 * the solution for pseudo-random sequence

I am looking forward your feedback and know why for some of you the program behaves strangely.

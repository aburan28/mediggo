*Present content and status of Megiddo: the open source cryptanalysis library*

= Introduction =

Megiddo get new features regularly. At the present time, here are the cryptanalysis techniques available:

* Detection of weakly implemented or weakly used encryption system in stream cipher mode (Vernam ciphers, pseudo-random stram ciphers, block ciphers in stream cipher mode). This covers also the case of intentional implementation or mathematical backdoors (for some of them)

* Cryptanalysis of the above-mentioned cases. The encryption system can remain unknown and the attack does not require any brute force key search

* Tools to build statistical model (corpus) of natural languages

* Tool to extract encrypted data from Office documents (Word and Excel; up to Office 2003)

This library has been tested successfully under Linux SuSe x64 (gcc 4.4.1; branch revision 150839).

 * meddigo.h.......General header file for the Meddigo library
 * texte_extract.c...... Extract encrypted data in MS Word and MS Excel document (up to Office 2003).
 * detect.c..... Detect parallel (aka weak) ciphertexts in a ciphertext directory.Weak ciphertexts can be produced by stream ciphers (pseudo-random generators or Vernam systems) or by block ciphers in stream cipher mode.

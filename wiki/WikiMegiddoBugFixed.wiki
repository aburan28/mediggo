Bug fixed in Megiddo library

= Introduction =

Minor bug and platform/compiler-dependent bug is now fixed in release 0.2.2. 
Comparison of unsigned char array was going weird with the strcmp function for some
environment and compiler. The replacement with the function strncmp makes now the code work well under any environment.

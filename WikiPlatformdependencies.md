Platform dependencies

I have recently used Mediggo in my cryptanalysis course and a few students did not obtain the same results on test set Ciphertexts2. The reason is that my code works for 64-bit platform. Moreover a few compilers (including a few versions of GCC) behave strangely.

This code has been validated under OpenSuse 11.4, 64-bit version. If you have troubles please email me. I will be very pleased to help you.
